# Borris Bikes Challenge
A challenge set by Makers Academy to teach test driven development. The result was a console app that simulate Borris Bikes dociking stations, bikes and infastructure. 

## Unit testsesting
Unit tests can be run using the following command:

```
$ rspec
```

## The Challenges

London's [Boris Bikes](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles) (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. Anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.

### Welcome to being a developer

Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (that was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

To help structure your work, here are 22 challenges. They all build on one another. They require you to research things, to get stuck, and to find your own solutions. This is on purpose. A developer is a 'knowledge worker' - someone who will spend the majority of their time researching and learning how to solve problems. It'll suck for a bit, but with practice, you will get faster: and there's no better feeling than finding the answer to a problem that's been standing in your way for hours.

## Focus goals

Mindful engagement with these challenges can help you achieve these goals:

<dl>
  <dt>I write code that is easy to change</dt>
  <dd>Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.</dd>
  <dt>I can test-drive my code</dt>
  <dd>Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.</dd>
  <dt>I can build with objects</dt>
  <dd>Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.</dd>
  <dt>I know how my language works</dt>
  <dd>Understanding your language is important because it helps you reason and communicate about software effectively. This makes your teams more effective, and most software is made by teams.</dd>
